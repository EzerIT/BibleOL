I added virtualkeyboard. This modifies Array.prototype (by adding functions concat, copy, pop, push,
shift, slice, splice, unshift, indexOf, lastIndexOf, map, unique, flatten, filter, binSearch,
heapSort, range); this means that I can no longer do

          for (var x in arr)

even though I know that arr contains only numeric indexes.

I cannot blindly change to

         for (var x=0, len=arr.len; x<len; ++x)

because that will not work with a sparsely populated array such as singleMonads.
Instead I do this:

          for (var x in arr) {
              if (isNaN(+x)) continue; // Not numeric
              ...
          }

Gradually, this should be changed to the ordinary loop where possible.
