      Ezra SIL is the same typeface as SIL Ezra and is fashioned after the 
      square letter forms of the typography of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 
      (BHS), a beautiful Old Testament volume familiar to biblical Hebrew scholars. 
      The Ezra SIL font is an OpenType 'smart' font.  

      Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

           * Ezra SIL version 2.5 (Containing the basic set of Unicode 
              characters needed for Biblical Hebrew texts following the 
              typeface and traditions of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia.)
           * Ezra SIL SR version 2.5 (Containing the same set of Unicode 
              characters as above but with a different style of cantillation.) 

      SIL International is the creator of the Ezra SIL fonts, and is the owner
      of all proprietary rights therein.

      More detail on the font can be seen at
      http://scripts.sil.org/EzraSIL_home.

      PREAMBLE
      
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free
      and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
      partnership with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.  The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works.  The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license.  The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to 
      any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
      
      DEFINITIONS
