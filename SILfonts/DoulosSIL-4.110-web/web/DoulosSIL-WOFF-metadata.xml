      Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a single 
      face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other Times-like fonts where 
      a range of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.
      
      The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
      that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
      Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
      orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
      symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
      technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
      position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.
      
      One font from this typeface family is included in this release:
      
           * Doulos SIL Regular 
      
      
      A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Doulos" and "SIL" in
      the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Doulos
      SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
      this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
      in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
      as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used, 
      unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and 
      "Doulos SIL" is not the resulting font family name.
      
      TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
      terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
      prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
      making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
      name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named 
      "Doulos SIL Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made 
      with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Doulos" and "SIL" 
      Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Servant Foo".
