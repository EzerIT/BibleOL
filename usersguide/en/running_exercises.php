<h1>Running Exercises</h1>


<p>In this section we will look at how you run an exercise. We will go through a couple of examples
    that you can try out on the system.</p>

<p>NOTE: You need not be logged in to try the code in this example, but you may see some warnings if
    you are not logged in.</p>

<p>Exercises are located in folders in much the same way files on a computer are located in folders.
    You can access the exercises by selecting <i>Exercises</i> from the <i>Text and exercises</i> menu.
    You will then see a list of folders that are found within the top level folder:</p>

<?= $hdir->img('toplevel.png') ?>

<p>The contents of some folders are available to all students, but you will see that some of the
    folders here are marked &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo;. These are folders that are only available to
    students that are enrolled in certain classes. Students&rsquo; access to folders is
    <?= help_anchor('folders#folder_visibility','controlled by teachers') ?>.</p>

<p>You should study at least one of these sets of examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Examples of Hebrew exercises:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><?= help_anchor('firstex/heb', 'First Hebrew exercise') ?>.</li>
        <li><?= help_anchor('secondex/heb', 'Second Hebrew exercise') ?>.</li>
        <li><?= help_anchor('thirdex/heb', 'Third Hebrew exercise') ?>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Examples of Greek exercises:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><?= help_anchor('firstex/gr', 'First Greek exercise') ?>.</li>
        <li><?= help_anchor('secondex/gr', 'Second Greek exercise') ?>.</li>
        <li><?= help_anchor('thirdex/gr', 'Third Greek exercise') ?>.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
