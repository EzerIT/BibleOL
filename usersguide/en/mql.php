<h1>MQL</h1>

<p>Bible OL is based on <?= anchor('https://www.emdros.org','Emdros',['target'=>'_blank']) ?>,
    a database engine for handling analysed or annotated text. Emdros was
    developed by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen of Aalborg University.</p>

<p>An important part of Emdros is an advanced query language, MQL, which makes
  it possible to search a text for specific constructs. MQL queries can be
  quite simple, such as &ldquo;find all verbs in the past tense&rdquo;, or very complex,
  such as &rdquo;find all sentences containing a singular pronoun, followed by at
  most three words, followed by a verb in the present tense, except cases
  where the verb is derived from <i>to be</i>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Most people using Bible OL need never learn MQL. If you are interested, you may
