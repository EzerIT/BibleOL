<h1>The Exam for OTST552 students</h1>

<p>The BibleOL-based Hebrew Final Exam is provided by the OT department and contains the following elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vocabulary</strong>: Students will be asked 20 words. Students need to provide glosses they have learned as part of their vocab training. Students must use the AUP-based vocab builder to make sure their learned glosses match the ones in the BibleOL (a simplified pdf version will be provided until AUP has published its vocab builder).</li>
	<li><strong>Morphology of Verbs</strong>: Students must answer 20 verbal forms (covering all tenses, all stems, all verbal classes, suffixed and non-suffixed forms).</li>
	<li><strong>Phrase analysis</strong>: Students must translate 10 clauses by identifying the phrase function of the different phrases in clauses and sentences. BibleOL will provide the meaning of unknown words if they do appear.</li>
	<li><strong>Clause-relation analysis</strong>: Student must translate ~5 sentences by identifying clause relations (independent vs. dependent clause [relative clause, object clause]).</li>
</ul>

<p>Students get access to each BibleOL-based exercise used in the final exam before taking the exam. Access will be given to them when they enroll in a Hebrew-I course. Consequently, students can exercise with these materials and get a realistic sense of the final exam before the actual exam day. If a student performs at a top level when doing the exercises, the student will know that she or he will perform well in the final exam. No surprises should be expected. This is because the data pool for the exam-prep exercises is identical to the actual exam.</p>

<p>The table below provides access to each part of the exam. Each exam part is <strong>hyperlinked</strong> (underlined, blue table headers) so that students can begin exam preparations.</p>
