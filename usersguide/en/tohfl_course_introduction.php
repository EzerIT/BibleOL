<h1>The Hebrew TOHFL course</h1>

<p>This Hebrew TOHFL course was created to represent a standard course teaching all essential vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and translation skills required by the accrediting institutions (VU, AU, PThU, ETF, Nida). Since each institution might use different textbooks, this course does not adopt a specific textbook but uses the widely used Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar with a few more sources:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Merwe, Christo H. van der, and Jacobus A. Naud&eacute;. <em>A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar</em>.&nbsp;2nd edition. London, New York: T&amp;T Clark, 2017.</li>
	<li>Glanz, Oliver. <em>Biblical Hebrew Reviewer: A Universal Study Companion</em>. Berrien Springs: Andrews University Press, 2018.</li>
	<li>TOHFL vocab booklet (download vocab booklet for TOHFL course I <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M2qKlc_GG3xpYIZwBIJ9ZR9tEa858hZC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, and TOHFL course II <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpiqLM_MNmO0zE7Y5IyZezc-TEiocuH2/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since this course does not use a textbook, it follows a text-driven approach in which vocabulary and grammar are not learned in the abstract but are closely related to the texts being translated through both TOHFL courses. TOHFL-I will work with Gen 19-20. TOHFL-II will work with Gen 19-20, Ruth 1, and Psa 3. The vocabulary of each course will cover the words found in the texts to be translated in the respective courses.</p>

<ul>
	<li>TOHFL-I will cover the basic morphology of the regular verb, vocabulary down to an occurrence of 200x, morphology of the noun, and basic syntax.</li>
	<li>TOHFL-II will cover all guttural and weak verb classes, vocabulary down to an occurrence of 100x, valence, syntax, and basic text grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each course contains lessons. Each lesson consists of a video lecture paired with corresponding assignments. The assignments are based on BibleOL and are freely accessible. In this way, all the BibleOL advantages are available to the user (instant feedback, self-grading, watching one&rsquo;s performance development).</p>

<p>Both courses have a final exam. Each of the accrediting institutions is responsible for scheduling the exam and for administrating the certification of completion (if a student has passed the final). The material used for the final exam is made available in advance so that students can practice and prepare for the final exam accordingly.</p>
