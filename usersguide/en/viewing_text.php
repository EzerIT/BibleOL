<h1>Viewing Text</h1>

<p>The most basic operation of Bible OL is that of viewing the Hebrew or Greek text of the Bible.
    From the <i>Text and Exercises</i> menu select <i>Display text.</i> This will take you to a web page
    displaying this dialog:</p>

<?= $hdir->img("selecttext.png") ?>

Under &ldquo;Corpus&rdquo; in that dialog, you select the text database you want to use. You have four options:

<ul>
    <li><i>Hebrew (ETCBC4, OT):</i> This is the Hebrew text of the Old Testament as provided by the ETCBC4
        database (see Appendix XXX).</li>
    <li><i>Hebrew (ETCBC4, Transliterated, OT):</i> This is the Hebrew text of the Old Testament as provided by
        the ETCBC4 database, but written with Latin letters.</li>
    <li><i>Greek (Nestle 1904,NT):</i> This is the Greek text of the New Testament as provided by the Nestle
        1904 database (see Appendix XXX).</li>
    <li><i>Jerome&rsquo;s Vulgate (NT with omissions):</i> This is the Latin text of the Vulgate translation of
        the New Testament (see Appendix XXX).</li>
</ul>

<p>You should read at least one of these sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li><?= anchor(site_url('help/show_help/viewing_text2/heb'), 'How to use Bible Online Learner to study a Hebrew text') ?>.</li>
    <li><?= anchor(site_url('help/show_help/viewing_text2/gr'), 'How to use Bible Online Learner to study a Greek text') ?>.</li>
</ul>
