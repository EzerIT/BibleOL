	<p>Start testing yourself with the Final Exam material. The final exam consists of four parts:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Vocab: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_01_SDATS_Vocabulary.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be asked ~20 randomly selected words appearing more than 100 times.</li>
		<li>Morphology: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_41_SDATS_morphology_verbal-forms.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with&nbsp;~20 randomly selected verbal forms to analyze.</li>
		<li>Syntax Phrase Functions: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_51_SDATS_syntax_phrase-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~10 randomly selected clauses, of which you need to identify the phrase function of some of the contained phrases.</li>
		<li>Syntax Clause Connections: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_52_SDATS_syntax_clause-connection-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~8 clauses. You will have to determine the nature of each clause (independent, dependent, attributive, object, or object clause).<br />
		<br />
		Each exam part contains a comprehensive description with a video tutorial. Take your time to get acquainted with the exam material and use it to your advantage. The more you test yourself, the better you will get in the final exam. The final exam will use the same data pool as the above-listed BOL exercises. Thus, no surprises are to be expected in the final exam.<br />

	<p>Continue testing yourself with the Final Exam material. The final exam consists of four parts:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Vocab: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_01_SDATS_Vocabulary.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be asked ~20 randomly selected words appearing more than 100 times.</li>
		<li>Morphology: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_41_SDATS_morphology_verbal-forms.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with&nbsp;~20 randomly selected verbal forms to analyze.</li>
		<li>Syntax Phrase Functions: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_51_SDATS_syntax_phrase-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~10 randomly selected clauses, of which you need to identify the phrase function of some of the contained phrases.</li>
		<li>Syntax Clause Connections: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_52_SDATS_syntax_clause-connection-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~8 clauses. You will have to determine the nature of each clause (independent, dependent, attributive, object, or object clause).<br />
		<br />
		Each exam part contains a comprehensive description with a video tutorial. Take your time to get acquainted with the exam material and use it to your advantage. The more you test yourself, the better you will get in the final exam. The final exam will use the same data pool as the above-listed BOL exercises. Thus, no surprises are to be expected in the final exam.<br />

In the final exam, you will be asked ~20 randomly selected words appearing more than 100 times.</li>
		<li>Morphology: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_41_SDATS_morphology_verbal-forms.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with&nbsp;~20 randomly selected verbal forms to analyze.</li>
		<li>Syntax Phrase Functions: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_51_SDATS_syntax_phrase-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~10 randomly selected clauses, of which you need to identify the phrase function of some of the contained phrases.</li>
		<li>Syntax Clause Connections: <a href="https://learner.bible/text/show_quiz?quiz=Andrews%20University%2F0_Hebrew-Qualifier%2FHebrew-02_52_SDATS_syntax_clause-connection-analysis.3et&amp;count=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here</a> is the testing data the&nbsp;Final Exam draws from. In the final exam, you will be presented with ~8 clauses. You will have to determine the nature of each clause (independent, dependent, attributive, object, or object clause).<br />
		<br />
		Each exam part contains a comprehensive description with a video tutorial. Take your time to get acquainted with the exam material and use it to your advantage. The more you test yourself, the better you will get in the final exam. The final exam will use the same data pool as the above-listed BOL exercises. Thus, no surprises are to be expected in the final exam.</li>
