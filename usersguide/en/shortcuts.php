<h1>How to Use Shortcuts</h1>

<p>If you are using a computer with a keyboard, you can use keyboard keys as shortcuts when
answering questions.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;>&rdquo; sign in the left part of the question window indicates the question that is currently affected by your keystrokes:</p>

<?= $hdir->img("shortcut-arrow.png") ?>

<p>Use the keys <i>Down Arrow</i> or <i>Up Arrow</i> to move between lines in the current sub-question.</p>

<p>Use the keys <i>Page Down</i> or <i>Page Up</i> to move to the next/previous sub-question.</p>

<p>Use <i>Ctrl-Down Arrow</i> (in Windows) or <i>Command-Down Arrow</i> (on a Mac) to go to the next
question. Note: There is no way to go back to the previous question! This is equivalent to clicking
on the &rdquo;Next&rdquo; button below the question.</p>

<p><i>Ctrl-G</i> (in Windows) or <i>Command-G</i> (on a Mac) is equivalent to clicking on the
&ldquo;Check answer&rdquo; button.</p>

<p><i>Ctrl-J</i> (in Windows) or <i>Command-J</i> (on a Mac) is equivalent to clicking on the
&ldquo;Show answer&rdquo; button.</p>

<p><i>Ctrl-S</i> (in Windows) or <i>Command-S</i> (on a Mac) turns shortcut indicators on and off.
Shortcut indicators are small squares containing the shortcut key. They are displayed in the corner
of a rectangle containing an option. By default, shortcut indicators are shown on large screen
(typically, computers) and they are not shown on small screens (phones or tablets).</p>
