<h1>Answering Gloss Requests</h1>

<p>Occasionally an exercise may ask you to provide the English translation of a foreign word &ndash; the <i>gloss</i>.</p>

<p>Very often, a foreign word has several translations into English. For example, the
  Hebrew word <span class="help hebrew">רוּחַ</span> may mean <i>breath, wind,</i> or <i>spirit</i>. When Bible OL
  asks for a translation of <span class="help hebrew">רוּחַ</span>, it is enough to provide one of these words:</p>

<?= $hdir->img("ans_gloss1.png") ?>

<p>As you can see from the check mark, Bible OL has accepted the answer &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;. If you click
  “Show answer”, all the correct answers appear:</p>
