     '<h1>Indentation Information for Hebrew Clauses</h1>

      <p>The Hebrew text now contains information about how a clause relates to its surrounding
      text. This is indicated by an “indentation level,” which can be displayed by selecting
      <i>Clause &gt Indentation</i> when viewing a Hebrew text.</p>

      <h1>What Is Bible Online Learner?</h1>

      <p>Bible Online Learner (Bible OL) gives free access to the Hebrew Bible in the ETCBC4
       database and Nestle’s 1904 text of the Greek New Testament with grammatical annotations;
       furthermore, teachers can use exercises developed for Bible OL or create their own.</p>

       <p>Bible OL is interlinked with the award-winning Hebrew query and text display site <a
       href="http://shebanq.ancient-data.org" target="shebanq">SHEBANQ</a>. From a chapter in Bible
       OL, click the SHEBANQ logo to jump directly to that chapter on their website. Furthermore,
       facilitators can use queries from SHEBANQ to generate exercises in Bible OL.</p>

       <p>The source code for Bible OL is available at <a href="https://github.com/EzerIT/BibleOL"
       target="_blank">GitHub</a>. We hope developers will fork this code and join us to add
       additional features.</p>';
