       <p>Bible OL is interlinked with the award-winning Hebrew query and text display site <a

       OL, click the SHEBANQ logo to jump directly to that chapter on their website. Furthermore,
       facilitators can use queries from SHEBANQ to generate exercises in Bible OL.</p>

       <p>The source code for Bible OL is available at <a href="https://github.com/EzerIT/BibleOL"

       additional features.</p>';
