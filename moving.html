    <h1>Warning</h1>

    <p>For several years, Bible Online Learning has run on a server belonging to the Danish Bible
      Institute. Further development of Bible OL will be carried out by
      the <a href="https://ministry.americanbible.org/nida-institute" target="_blank">NIDA
      Institute</a>, and this means that the program must be moved to a new server.</p>

    <p>The move will probably take a few days. On 8 September 2023 we will make a copy of all data
    on the current server and move that to the new server. This means that anything that is changed
    on the old server on or after that date will not be transferred. This includes new user accounts, new
    classes, new exercises and not least statistics about exercises you make.</p>

    <p>When the new server is ready, you will be able to continue work there with the data you had
    on 8 September.</p>

    <p>Questions can be directed to your teacher or to <a href="mailto:claus@tondering.dk">Claus
        TÃ¸ndering</a>.</p>

    <p>(Note: Although we expect to start the move on 8 September, unforeseen events may cause a
    delay. Any updates will be posted here.)
